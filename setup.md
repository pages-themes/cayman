# Setup Instructions

## General computing requirements

There are a few computing requirements for the course that are absolutely necessary (beyond the few software packages we would like you to install, described below):

1. You must have administrator access to your computer (i.e., you must be able to install things yourself without requesting IT approval).
1. You must have at least 40 GB of free disk space on your computer (but we would recommend more, to be safe).
1. If you are using Windows you must be using Windows 10; Windows 7 and 8 will not be sufficient for this course.

If you foresee any of these being a problem please reach out to one of the instructors for what steps you can take to ensure you are ready for the course start on July 26th.

## Required software

To get the most out of our course, we ask that you arrive with the following software already installed:

- A command-line shell: Bash
- A version control system: Git
- A remote-capable text editor: VSCode
- Python 3 via Miniconda
- A virtualization system: Docker
- A GitHub account
- Slack
- Zoom
- A modern browser

The rest of this page provides more detail on installation procedures for each of the above elements, with separate instructions for each of the three major operating systems (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux).

### Some quick general notes on instructions

- There is no difference between `Enter` and `Return` in these instructions, so just press whatever the equivalent on your keyboard is whenever one is stated
- If you already have some of these things installed on your computer already that should (theoretically) be okay.
  - However, for example, having multiple different Python installations on your computer can lead to incredibly frustrating issues that are very difficult to debug.
    As such, if you have already installed Python via some other application (not Miniconda/Anaconda), we strongly encourage you to uninstall it before following the instructions below.
    You _must_ have Python installed via Miniconda for this course.

### OS-specific installation instructions

Select the link that corresponds to your operating system and follow the instructions therein.

* [Linux](./linux-setup.html)
* [Mac](./mac-setup.html)
* [Windows](./windows-setup.html)

### GitHub account

Go to https://github.com/join/ and follow the on-screen instructions to create an account.
It is a good idea to associate this with your university e-mail (if you have one) as this will entitle you to sign up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) which comes with some nice free bonuses.

### Slack

Go to https://slack.com/downloads/ and download and install Slack.

### Zoom

Go to https://zoom.us/download and download and install the Zoom client.

### Modern web browser

Install Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.
